A Link to the Past Randomizer client for go.

ALTTPR has a, mostly undocumented, API that allows bots and scripts to grab and
apply randomized configurations of A Link to the Past. This is a go client that
does the same thing.

An attempt was made to write more idiomatic go than my BPS patcher, but i'm
still a pythonist at heart so I'm sure it's not quite right.


TODO
----

* Better support for creating and saving configurations.
* Support for automatically pulling down standard configurations from alttpr site
